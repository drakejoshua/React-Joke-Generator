# React-Joke-Generator

A sample web project that i'm using to practice how to use React by building a simple joke generator app
and sharpen react usage on tools like stateful functional components, react hooks, axios.js, tailwindCSS and react's recouncilation.

This is a simple react webapp( built using vite, react, google material symbols, axios.js, react hooks, stateful functional components,
prop-types and tailwindCSS. ). This project is just to illustrate my usage and to also learn preliminary parts of react
( such as: stateful functional components, states, react hooks etc ). It's a complete beginner project and posses no advance level code just
plain react and usage of simple external framworks.
